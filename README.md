# Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!

**About Me**

I discovered my passion for data while working as a real-time analyst. Curious and driven to learn, I've been mastering SQL and exploring Python through courses and hands-on projects. My GitHub currently hosts two SQL projects, one of them containing data visualization using Tableau, that highlight my journey. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to grow in the world of data!

**Projects**

Here are some of the projects I am currently working on or have completed:
Supermarket sales analysis (ongoing): In Bassim Eledath's ["Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/exploratory-data-analysis-python-pandas) project, Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are used to analyze historical sales data from a supermarket. The analysis includes transforming data types, exploring distributions with histograms and count plots, and conducting time-series analysis to identify trends in gross income over three months. The project demonstrates effective data cleaning techniques and insightful visualizations to understand sales patterns and customer behavior.

Mental health survey Analysis (completed): This project delves into intricate patterns and correlations within a mental health survey dataset using SQL. I analyzed respondents' demographics, employment status, and treatment-seeking behaviors. The insights were visualized using Tableau, enhancing the clarity and accessibility of findings. This comprehensive approach highlights my proficiency in data preparation, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization with Tableau.

Order analysis (completed): Exploration of sales and customer data, following a guided project of "Advanced SQL Retrieval Queries," I tackle questions ranging from calculating average prices to identifying top-selling products and analyzing discount utilization. 

**Getting Started**

To explore my projects, simply navigate to the respective project directories in my repositories. Each project contains a README file with detailed information about the project, including dataset sources, analysis techniques, and conclusions.

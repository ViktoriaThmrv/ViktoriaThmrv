# Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!

**About Me**

I'm thrilled to share my journey into the fascinating world of data with you. My passion for data was ignited during my time working as a real-time analyst. As I delved deeper into the realm of data analytics, I found myself captivated by the endless possibilities and insights that could be gleaned from data.

Driven by my curiosity and thirst for knowledge, I embarked on a journey of continuous learning. I enrolled in various courses, engaged in hands-on practice labs, and dedicated myself to developing projects. Through these experiences, I developed my skills in SQL and embarked on a mission to master Python.

In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of my SQL projects, each representing a milestone in my learning journey. As I continue to expand my skill set and delve into the realm of data, I look forward to sharing more projects with you. Stay tuned for updates.

**Projects**

Here are some of the projects I am currently working on or have completed:

Mental Health Survey Analysis (in progress): Delve into the intricate patterns and correlations within a mental health survey dataset. Using PostgreSQL, I analyze respondents' demographics, employment status, and treatment-seeking behavior. From standardizing data to dissecting treatment-seeking behavior by gender, these queries showcase my proficiency in data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory analysis.

Order Analysis (completed): Exploration of sales and customer data, following a guided project of "Advanced SQL Retrieval Queries," I tackle questions ranging from calculating average prices to identifying top-selling products and analyzing discount utilization. 

**Getting Started**

To explore my projects, simply navigate to the respective project directories in my repositories. Each project contains a README file with detailed information about the project, including dataset sources, analysis techniques, and conclusions.

Feel free to clone or fork the repositories to explore the projects further, provide feedback, or collaborate on new ideas!

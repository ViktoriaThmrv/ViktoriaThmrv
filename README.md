# Welcome to my Data Analysis portfolio!

**About Me**

I discovered my passion for data while working as a real-time analyst. Curious and driven to learn, I've been mastering SQL and exploring Python through courses and hands-on projects. My GitHub currently hosts two SQL projects, one of them containing data visualization using Tableau, that highlight my journey. Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to grow in the world of data!

**Projects**

Here are some of the projects I am currently working on or have completed:

Mental Health Survey Analysis (completed): This project delves into intricate patterns and correlations within a mental health survey dataset using PostgreSQL. I analyzed respondents' demographics, employment status, and treatment-seeking behaviors. The insights were visualized using Tableau, enhancing the clarity and accessibility of findings. This comprehensive approach highlights my proficiency in data preparation, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization with Tableau.

Order Analysis (completed): Exploration of sales and customer data, following a guided project of "Advanced SQL Retrieval Queries," I tackle questions ranging from calculating average prices to identifying top-selling products and analyzing discount utilization. 

**Getting Started**

To explore my projects, simply navigate to the respective project directories in my repositories. Each project contains a README file with detailed information about the project, including dataset sources, analysis techniques, and conclusions.
